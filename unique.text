That’s a great question! To make your job portal website stand out from the crowd (e.g., Naukri, LinkedIn, Indeed), you’ll need to add unique features, enhance user experience, and possibly target a specific niche or audience.

🔥 1. Unique Value Propositions (UVPs)
✅ Niche Focus (Optional but powerful)
Example: Focus on freshers, remote jobs, freelancers, blue-collar workers, women returning to work, startup hiring, etc.

🌟 2. Features to Stand Out
🧠 Smart AI Matching (Recommendation Engine)
Suggest jobs to users based on skills, past applications, behavior, and resume parsing.

Suggest candidates to recruiters based on job description and screening criteria.

📹 Video Resume & Interview
Allow candidates to upload or record short video resumes.

Built-in asynchronous video interview platform (answer questions via video).

⚙️ Skill-Based Job Matching
Rather than just job titles, match candidates based on actual skills (like JavaScript, SEO, etc.).

Show % match on job cards.

🚀 Roadmap Tracker for Candidates
Guide users: “You need these 3 skills to apply for X job. Here’s how to learn them.”

Micro-courses, progress bars, and project submissions (integrate with Coursera/YouTube).

💡 Micro Projects / Challenges for Shortlisting
Instead of resumes, allow applicants to submit small tasks or code challenges.

Especially useful for tech/startups.

📱 3. User Experience Differentiators
🔍 Real-Time Chat with Recruiters
Built-in live chat or chat requests with status (online/offline) for recruiters.

🧭 Gamified Job Hunt
Earn badges like “Resume Expert”, “Profile 100% Complete”, “Applied to 10 jobs”, etc.

Adds engagement and fun.

📈 Career Analytics Dashboard
Show insights like:

Job trends in your industry

Where similar profiles are getting hired

Salary predictions

👥 4. Features for Recruiters (Not just Candidates!)
AI-generated JD builder

Filter candidates by skill-test scores, video answers, or project submissions

Shortlist board (Trello-style) to manage applicants

🔐 5. Trust & Transparency Features
Show real-time application stats (“42 people applied”, “3 shortlisted”)

Verified Company Badges

Anonymous reviews of hiring experience (Glassdoor-style mini-section)

🎯 Bonus Unique Ideas
1. WhatsApp-based Job Alerts
Integrate WhatsApp for job notifications and recruiter messages.

2. Voice-Enabled Job Search
Users can say “Show me remote UI/UX jobs” using voice search.

3. AI Resume Builder
